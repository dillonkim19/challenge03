DESCRIPTION
-----------
Using the fundamental concepts of JavaScript I have learned in this module, I want to create a password generator with prompts and alerts on the website. 

The password generator website will ask the user for the length and criteria (upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and/or special characters) of the password. Then a randomly generated password will show up on the screen. 

SCREENSHOTS
-----------
The following image shows the web application's appearance:
